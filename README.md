# Astro Schema Examples

This repository contains a number of minimal Astro implementations, with a variety of different content collection schemas in their `content.config.ts`.

This is intended solely for help with testing and developing [Astro Editor](https://astroeditor.danny.is/)

## Example Sites

- **`minimal-blog/`** - Basic blog with simple Zod schemas (title, description, date, tags)
- **`schema-patterns/`** - Demonstrates various Zod schema patterns (nested objects, arrays, unions, enums)
- **`comprehensive-schemas/`** - Complex schemas with advanced Zod features (transforms, refinements, optional fields)
- **`starlight-minimal/`** - Minimal Starlight documentation site using imported loaders and schemas from `@astrojs/starlight`
