# Task 1

I want to create an extremely basic astro site like a blog with one simple content collection that is extremely simple and stripped back for blog articles. Then I want to astro build so that I can compare this extremely minimal version with the generated JSON version.

# Future Tasks

- Basic Starlight Schema (straight from template)
- A site with has many content colelctions using every available basic feature of zod in Astro, with the glob loader, including at least one which references other content colelctions.
- Some super complex schema like https://github.com/withastro/astro.build/blob/main/src/content/config.ts
