# Note Testing MDX Components

This note tests how MDX components integrate with the notes collection.

<Callout type="info">
Notes can also use MDX components, though they're typically simpler than full articles.
</Callout>

## Component Use Cases in Notes

Notes might use components for:

### Quick References

<BookmarkCard
  title="Astro Documentation"
  description="The official Astro framework documentation"
  url="https://docs.astro.build"
  favicon="https://docs.astro.build/favicon.ico"
/>

### Highlighting Important Information

<Callout type="warning">
Remember to test component functionality in both articles and notes collections.
</Callout>

### Success Indicators

<Callout type="success">
MDX components should work seamlessly in notes just like in articles.
</Callout>

## Editor Testing

This note should:

1. **Show MDX badge** in the file list
2. **Handle component imports** properly
3. **Render components** in any preview mode
4. **Preserve component syntax** during editing
5. **Support component auto-completion** if available

The editor should treat MDX notes the same as MDX articles regarding component support and syntax highlighting.
